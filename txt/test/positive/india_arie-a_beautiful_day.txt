Life is a journey, 
Not a destination, 
There are no mistakes, 
Just chances we’ve taken 
Lay down your regrets cause all we have is now 
Wake up in the morning 
And get out of bed 
Start making a mental list in my head 
Of all of the things that I am grateful for 
Early in the morning 
It’s the dawn of a new day 
New hopes new dreams new ways 
I open up my eyes and 
I open up my mind and 
I wonder how life will surprise me today 
Early in the morning 
It’s the dawn of a new day 
New hopes new dreams new ways 
I open up my heart and 
I’m gon’ do my part and 
Make this a positively beautiful day 
La la la la la la la la la [x3]
It’s a Beautiful Day [x3]
Life is a challenge not a competition 
You can still smell the roses and be on a mission 
Just take a moment to get in touch with your heart 
Sometimes you feel like you’ve got something to prove 
Remind yourself that there’s only one you 
Just take a moment to give thanks of who you are 
Early in the morning 
It’s the dawn of a new day 
New hopes, new dreams, new ways 
I open up my eyes and 
I open up my mind and 
I wonder how life will surprise me today 
Early in the morning 
It’s the dawn of a new day 
New hopes, new dreams, new ways 
I open up my heart and 
I’m gon’ do my part and 
Make this a positively beautiful day 
La la la la la la la la la [x3]
It’s a Beautiful Day [x2]
Let’s make this a wonderful 
Let’s make this a powerful 
Let’s make this a Beautiful Day 
It’s a Beautiful Day 
Life is a journey, 
Not a destination, 
There are no mistakes, 
Just chances we’ve taken 
Lay down your regrets cause all we have is now
