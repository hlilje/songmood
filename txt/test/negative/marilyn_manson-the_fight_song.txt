Nothing suffocates you more than
The passing of everyday human events
Isolation is the oxygen mask you make
Your children breathe in to survive
But I'm not a slave to a god
That doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to a world
That doesn't give a shit
And when we were good
You just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
Fight, fight, fight, fight
You'll never grow up to be a big-
Rock-star-celebrated-victim-of-your-fame
They'll just cut our wrists like
Cheap coupons and say that death
Was on sale today
And when we were good
You just closed you eyes
So when we are bad
We'll scar your minds
But I'm not a slave to a god
That doesn't exist
But I'm not a slave to a world
That doesn't give a shit
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
The death of one is a tragedy
But death of a million is just a statistic
Fight, fight, fight, fight
