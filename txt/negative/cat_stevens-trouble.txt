\f0\fs26 \cf0 \cb2 Trouble\
Oh trouble set me free\
I have seen your face\
And it's too much too much for me\
Trouble\
Oh trouble can't you see\
You're eating my heart away\
And there's nothing much left of me\
I've drunk your wine\
You have made your world mine\
So won't you be fair\
So won't you be fair\
I don't want no more of you\
So won't you be kind to me\
Just let me go where\
I'll have to go there\
Trouble\
Oh trouble move away\
I have seen your face\
and it's too much for me today\
Trouble\
Oh trouble can't you see\
You have made me a wreck\
Now won't you leave me in my misery\
I've seen your eyes\
and I can see death's disguise\
Hangin' on me\
Hangin' on me\
I'm beat, I'm torn\
Shattered and tossed and worn\
Too shocking to see\
Too shocking to see\
Trouble\
Oh trouble move from me\
I have paid my debt\
Now won't you leave me in my misery\
Trouble\
Oh trouble please be kind\
I don't want no fight\
And I haven't got a lot of time}
