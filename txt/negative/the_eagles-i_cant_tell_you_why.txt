Look at us baby, up all night 
Tearing our love apart 
Aren't we the same two people who live 
through years in the dark? 
Ahh... 
Every time I try to walk away 
Something makes me turn around and stay 
And I can't tell you why 
When we get crazy, 
it just ain't to right, 
(try to keep you head, little girl) 
Girl, I get lonely, too 
You don't have to worry 
Just hold on tight 
(don't get caught in your little world) 
'Cause I love you 
Nothing's wrong as far as I can see 
We make it harder than it has to be 
and I can't tell you why 
no, baby, I can't tell you why 
I can't tell you why 
No, no, baby, I can't tell you why 
I can't tell you why 
I can't tell you why
