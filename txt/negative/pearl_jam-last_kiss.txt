\f0\fs26 \cf0 \cb2 Oh where, oh where, can my baby be? \
The Lord took her away from me.\
She's gone to heaven so I've got to be good, \
So I can see my baby when I leave this world.\
We were out on a date in my daddy's car,\
We hadn't driven very far.\
There in the road straight ahead,\
A car was stalled, the engine was dead.\
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right,\
I'll never forget the sound that night.\
The screaming tires, the busting glass,\
The painful scream that I heard last.\
When I woke up, the rain was falling down,\
There were people standing all around.\
Something warm flowing through my eyes,\
But somehow I found my baby that night.\
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said;\
"Hold me darling just a little while."\
I held her close I kissed her - our last kiss,\
I found the love that I knew I had missed.\
Well now she's gone even though I hold her tight,\
I lost my love, my life that night.\
